# Your first Python program
And finally, after my ranting about Python in the previous article, we can **finally** get to the good stuff, **ACUTAL PYTHON**. Before I explain the program, I'll just show it to you:
```Python
print("Hello world!")
```
Okay, so what did I just do here? Well, this program is supposed to display "Hello world!" to the screen (not in a gui window, in the terminal)
---
So the
```Python
print()
```
is whats called a **function**, or a **method** (any way is the correct way to say it).
We'll get into more detail about functions in later articles, but for now, just know that `print()` is a function. And the `"Hello world!"` that is inside the parenthesis is what we want the program to display to the terminal. Now, you may ask why we don't just put Hello world! into the parenthesis, and why we add the double quotes around. It's because of **data types.** Again, we'll go into data types in future tutorials, but the data type that ``"Hello world"`` is, is a string, a string is indicated by two double quotes `" "`, and inside those double quotes you put what you want to be inside the string.

# Challenge
Try and make your own Python program! Make it display something to the screen using the `print()` function, if you don't know where to write your program, I recommend using the Programiz online Python Interpreter.
