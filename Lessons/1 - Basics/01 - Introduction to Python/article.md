# Python Introduction
Welcome to your first steps into the language of Python! Before we get into the good stuff, we have to introduce Python. Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in 1991. Python still remains to this day one of the most popular, if not **the** most popular programming languages in the world. It is the source of many jobs and projects. Ever wondered how to make a robot? Python. Ever wondered how security cameras work? Python. Before this article gets too long, I'll just summarize it by saying that if you wanna make cool stuff, Python is the language for you.
